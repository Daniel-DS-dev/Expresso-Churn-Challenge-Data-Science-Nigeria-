# Expresso-Churn-Challenge-Data-Science-Nigeria

### This repository contains my solution to the Pre-Bootcamp hackathon organised by Data Science Nigeria (DSN) on Zindi, from 8 August — 22 August, 2020. (link to hackathon: https://zindi.africa/hackathons/dsn-pre-bootcamp-hackathon-expresso-churn-prediction-challenge/data)

### Main Objective: Develop a predictive model that determines the likelihood for a customer to churn, i.e. stop purchasing airtime and data from Expresso.
### Evaluation Metric: Log loss
### Machine Learning Models/Algorithms Used: This solution was built on the stack of 3 models (CatBoost, LGBM and XGBoost).
## This solution gave me a log loss score of: 0.247057826917659.

* Expresso is an African telecommunications company that provides customers with airtime and mobile data bundles. The objective of this challenge is to develop a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of each Expresso customer “churning,” i.e. becoming inactive and not making any transactions for 90 days.
* This solution will help Expresso to better serve their customers by understanding which customers are at risk of leaving
